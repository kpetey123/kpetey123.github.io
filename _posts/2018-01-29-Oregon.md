## The Oregon Coast

For those adventurers who want to see some breath-taking views you have to visit the Oregon Coast.  My wife and I journeyed there in the fall of 2017 and we were blown away by how majestic the mountain ranges were and how beautiful the coastline was.  The crystal blue-green water crashing against the gray-brown rocks looks like something out of a movie.  We had unusually warm weather for the Northwestern part of the United States, but it was still in the mid 70's most days.  

We dropped my son off at college in Redmond, WA just outside of Seattle then crossed toward the coastline and headed south.  We drove into Portland, OR spent the afternoon sampling some of the amazing food trucks in the downtown area on a Sunday afternoon, then headed for our first campsite near the coast.  The next 4 days we drove right down the coast on Highway 1 into California all the way to San Francisco.

We stopped a few wineries along the way and there were plenty.  I would highly recommend the Williamette Valley for some great Pinot Noir in Oregon. While we spent a lot of time driving, we had a fantastic vacation and we will definitely be going there again.
